    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Home Cents Family Budgeting</strong></p>
    <p class="subtitle">Last Updated: January 16, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Home Cents Family Budgeting ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.</p>
    <p class="highlight"><strong>The short version:</strong> Your data stays on your device. We don't collect, store, or sell your personal information.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
    <p>Home Cents Family Budgeting is designed with privacy in mind. We do NOT:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collect your personal information</li>
        <li>Store your financial data on our servers</li>
        <li>Track your location</li>
        <li>Access your contacts</li>
        <li>Share any information with third parties</li>
        <li>Display advertisements</li>
        <li>Sell or monetize your data in any way</li>
    </ul>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>Information Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>All data you enter into Home Cents Family Budgeting is stored locally on your device using secure, encrypted storage. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Income entries</li>
        <li>Expense entries and transaction history</li>
        <li>Budget categories and amounts</li>
        <li>Vendor names</li>
        <li>Receipt scan results</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>This data never leaves your device</strong> unless you explicitly choose to export it in a future version of the app.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>Camera Usage</h2>
    <p>Home Cents Family Budgeting requests camera access solely for the receipt scanning feature. When you scan a receipt:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The photo is temporarily processed on your device</li>
        <li>The image data is sent to a third-party AI service (Anthropic's Claude API) for text extraction</li>
        <li>Only the extracted text (item names, prices, store name) is returned</li>
        <li>The original image is not stored or retained by any external service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can use the app without granting camera access—manual expense entry is always available.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The receipt scanning feature uses <strong>Anthropic's Claude API</strong> to read and categorize receipt text. When you scan a receipt:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The receipt image is sent to Anthropic's servers for processing</li>
        <li>Anthropic processes the image to extract text only</li>
        <li>No personal identifying information is sent with the request</li>
        <li>Anthropic's privacy policy governs their handling of this data: <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy">https://www.anthropic.com/privacy</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use any other third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Your financial data is stored using your device's built-in secure storage mechanisms. We recommend:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keeping your device passcode enabled</li>
        <li>Keeping your device operating system up to date</li>
        <li>Being cautious about who has physical access to your device</li>
    </ul>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Home Cents Family Budgeting is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
    
    <hr>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect your data, there's nothing to request, correct, or delete from our systems. All your data is on your device, and you can delete it at any time by:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Clearing the app's data in your device settings</li>
        <li>Uninstalling the app</li>
